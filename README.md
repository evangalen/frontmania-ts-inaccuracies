# frontmania-ts-inaccuracies
Slidedeck & live-coding source-code of FrontMania 2023 talk `TypeScript inaccuracies? Letâ€™s fix those types!`

## Source-code of live-coding
The source-code is under the `src` folder.
During the presentation I use the VSCode [Bookmarks extension])(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks),
to quickly navigate to the next file without having to interact with the Explorer view of VSCode.

## Slide-deck
PDF of the slide-deck can be found [here](./frontmania-ts-inaccuracies-slidedeck.pdf) in the repo.
